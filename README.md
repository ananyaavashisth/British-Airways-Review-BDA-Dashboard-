## Project Insights
The interactive dashboard revealed key trends in customer satisfaction for British Airways. Users could identify that service aspects like cabin staff generally received higher ratings, while food quality and seat comfort had more mixed feedback. Geographic analysis showed that customers from different regions rated services differently, highlighting cultural or regional expectations. Additionally, monthly trends helped detect seasonal dips in satisfaction, potentially linked to travel rush or operational strain. These insights can guide the airline in prioritizing service improvements and tailoring experiences for specific traveler types or routes.
## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the power of interactive data visualization using Tableau to transform static customer reviews into actionable insights. By enabling dynamic filtering and comparative analysis across various service metrics, the dashboard enhances data storytelling and supports informed decision-making. It not only showcases technical proficiency in data handling and visualization but also emphasizes the importance of user-centric design in analytics tools for the aviation industry.
